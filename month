1. Write the shell script to take file name as input and if file exists then print the number 
of lines and also print 10th line of that file.
vi prog13.sh
echo "Enter a filename"
read a
if [ -f $a]
then
        echo "File exist"
        d=$(wc -l $a)
        echo "Number of lines are : $d"
        s=$(sed -n '10p' i1)
        echo "The 10th line is : $s"
else
        echo "File doesnot exist"
fi
